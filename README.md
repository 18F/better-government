# What is the Better Goverment Movement?

The Better Government Movement seeks to answer this question: how might we effectively serve the many talented Federal employees who have the motivation and potential to cause change?

Since the movement launched in March, we’ve convened more than 300 people across the government to envision a better government. Through crowdsourcing, we’ve defined what we mean by better government, what is stopping us from innovating, and have created a series of six plays to guide innovation across the government. Soon, we'll launch or initial findings on Innovation.gov and will expand to expand to a Toolkit later in 2017.
