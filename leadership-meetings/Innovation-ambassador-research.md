## Alliance for Innovation Ambassador Program

Ambassadors are the emerging leaders in the member organizations that help us grow engagement, share ideas, and champion innovation – they are the fuel that helps the Alliance keep running. Through the Alliance Ambassador Program, a deeper connection with the Alliance and your organization is fostered. Ambassadors focus on increasing engagement and awareness about Alliance activities and events, as well as help facilitate the idea sharing coming out of your organization.

&quot;The Alliance for Innovation Ambassador Program continues to be a valuable resource for building and promoting an innovative culture throughout our organization. Not only has the Ambassador Program been able to improve idea sharing internally throughout our organization, but has provided easy access and communication with other municipalities who are always looking for new ideas on how to improve the quality of life in their community&quot; - Jenna Hurley, Administrative Assistant/Community Events Coordinator, City of Mason, OH and Alliance Ambassador

AMBASSADORS SUSTAIN AND STRENGTHEN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR ORGANIZATIONS AND THE ALLIANCE BY:

- ENGAGING: The most important role for the Ambassadors is to help grow engagement. While your Regional Director can introduce staff to the Alliance and the tools and benefits of membership, we rely on the Ambassadors to champion the message and build awareness of the Alliance&#39;s message.
- SHARING NEW IDEAS: The Alliance only works if local governments share ideas with us. Since the Regional Directors are only three staff members, we rely on the Ambassadors to be our eyes and hears about what is happening in local government so we can share your ideas with the larger Alliance community.
- BUILDING CULTURES OF INNOVATION: While the City Manager and traditional leadership of the organization are vital to building an innovative culture, the Ambassadors serve as an informal group of emerging leaders from all different parts of local government championing innovation. The Alliance doesn&#39;t believe in a one-size-fits all approach to innovation. Instead, we believe in connecting the emerging leaders throughout the Alliance to share and discuss strategies to promote more innovation in local government.

SO WHY SHOULD YOU BECOME AN AMBASSADOR OR WHY SHOULD EVERY ALLIANCE MEMBER ORGANIZATION HAVE AT LEAST ONE AMBASSADOR?

The Ambassador program is an opportunity to become a leader in bringing change to local government. It&#39;s also a professional development opportunity to connect to emerging leaders across the country from various disciplines all interested in local government innovation. Whether you&#39;re building your innovative skillset through the [Ambassador Update](http://transformgov.org/en/news/ambassador_news), attending a live Ambassador Forum idea-exchange, connecting in the Ambassador Group, or more, you build skills and connections that build on the foundation for your career in local government.

If you are an Alliance member interested in becoming an Ambassador, please [contact your Regional Director](http://transformgov.org/en/about/regions).

FAQ about the Ambassadors

How many Ambassadors should we have?

It depends.  There are no limitations on the amount of Ambassadors you can have.  Depending on how large your organization is and/or how difficult it is to engage the entire organization, you may need more Ambassadors.  The more Ambassadors you have the more organizational engagement you&#39;ll see no matter your context.

How do we identify Ambassadors?

Ambassadors are already your emerging leaders.  They can be in any department at any role in the organization.  The Ambassador program is about empowering them to take a leadership role in the organization to help build a more innovative culture.

How do we recruit Ambassadors?

Outside of asking your staff, a great way to recruit Ambassadors is having your regional director do a presentation about the program.  Another way is to invite potential Ambassadors to a networking event with other Ambassadors so they understand more what the program is about.

What time commitment does being an Ambassador require?

The Ambassador Program benefit is based on what you put into it.  What we ask all Ambassadors to do is help us identify the emerging ideas in the organization and grow engagement by signing up accounts in their departments.

## [NASA Innovation Ambassadors Developmental Assignment](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibi-nc4fTTAhXKiFQKHT1hCygQFghQMAY&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2Foffices%2Fipp%2Finnovation_incubator%2Finnovation_transfusion%2Fit_ambassadors_develop.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSoZH9G8U_SeqM_3spZJx13Oh_OQ)

Qualified NASA employees are invited to apply to be Innovation Ambassadors under a new program sponsored by the Innovative Partnerships Program at NASA Headquarters.

&quot;NASA Selects First Innovation Ambassadors&quot; [› View Press Release](https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/aug/HQ_09_182_Innovation_Ambassadors.html)

The Innovation Ambassadors program will provide a temporary developmental assignment for select members of NASA&#39;s technical workforce. These employees will be assigned to work with a host external organization for up to one year. Shorter assignments of three months or more will also be considered. The host organization will have the benefit of the expertise of the NASA employee at no cost. The NASA employee will focus on improving their technical and management skills while learning, on a day-to-day basis, about the innovative technologies and processes used by the host organization. The Innovation Ambassador can also share ideas and approaches from their NASA experience. Following the assignment, the NASA employee will be expected to disseminate their new knowledge within NASA and lead efforts to implement new technologies and process improvements based on their experience. An additional benefit for NASA and the host organization is the potential for the Innovation Ambassadors activity to lead to future business partnerships and other interaction.

Innovation Ambassador applicants must be civil servant engineers, scientists, project managers or program managers at the GS-11 to GS-15 level. The host organization can be a private company, academic or research institution, national laboratory or another government agency. Innovation Ambassador applicants can propose work assignments at an external organization with which they have established their own contact. Also, the Innovative Partnerships Program Office is requesting information from external organizations interested in hosting an Ambassador and a list of those organizations will be provided to each Center Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) Office for reference by June 27. The NASA Headquarters IPP Office will fund the travel expenses for the Innovation Ambassador. However the salary of the Ambassador must be paid by their home organization and so the concurrence of the home organization supervisor is essential.

Interested employees should contact their Center IPP Office for additional guidance and to submit their application packages. Center IPP Offices will begin reviewing Innovation Ambassador applications by July 14, 2008. The Center IPP Office will forward a limited number of applications to NASA Headquarters for final selection by August 1, 2008. The date for submitting Center nominations has been extended to August 15, 2008.

For more information about the Innovation Ambassador program and the application requirements see the Developmental Assignment Guide and other links below. For Center IPP Office contacts see the list at this link: [Innovation Ambassadors Contact List](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/ipp/innovation_incubator/innovation_transfusion/it_ambassadors_poc.html).

About Ambassadors

As interest in social innovation has grown across campus, we have found that more students than ever are looking for a way to plug into the social innovation community on campus. We also believe that innovation happens in communities and that vibrant networks are critical to support exploration of and involvement in social innovation. SII Ambassadors will be a team of 4-6 students who will help build a connected, fun, and engaged social innovation community at Brown. Specifically, SII Ambassadors will be responsible for:

- Planning events that feature amazing speakers (students, alumni, and others) on topics related to social innovation and encourage connection and great discussion;
- Reaching out to students involved in social innovation at Brown to learn more about how they want to be involved with SII, what they want to learn, what resources they need, etc.
- Creating stronger connections and relationships with Brown alumni in social entrepreneurship to engage them as mentors, speakers, and supporters of social innovation at Brown.
- Coming up with new ways to involve and educate the campus community in social innovation

Qualifications

- Prior knowledge of social innovation/SII preferred (ex. Social Innovation Fellows, Brown Venture Launch Fund grantees, have taken courses in social innovation such as PPAI1910: Social Entrepreneurship, involvement in groups such as Design for America, A Better World by Design, and/or SEEED@Brown)
- Experience working as a part of a student team toward shared vision and goals
- Event planning experience
- Excellent community builder; experience reaching out to diverse populations, gathering feedback, creating new programs/opportunities

The SII Ambassador role will be a 3-5 hour/week time commitment (approximately). This is an unpaid position, but the work of SII Ambassadors will be supported by a budget for events and programs they develop. Funding is also available to support select SII Ambassadors in attending either the Ashoka U Exchange (held at University of Maryland in February 2015) or Ashoka U&#39;s new student-only conference (held in San Diego in April 2015).
