# Better Government Mission, Vision, and Principles

## Mission 
We transform the way the people of government work together, guided by principles, with realignment of, or new investment in, policies, processes, and technology. 

With a focus on efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability, we’ll create a more responsive and collaborative modern government, speaking directly toward the public’s needs and desires.

## Vision
We are a catalyst for improved quality of service to the public. In order to deliver concretely on our missions, we shift our thinking to improving our interactions and processes to provide more value to the public to be an economic driver for the nation. 

By collaborating with the public, we better understand their needs and provide efficient and effective solutions through innovation. We will be a leader in trust and accountability as we use new methods and proven practices to create a culture of excellence and data to drive decision-making.

Change should happen first with the government--to shift our thinking to improving our interactions and processes to provide more value to the public.
