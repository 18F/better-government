## What is a better government? 

We envision a better relationship between the government and the public. Change should happen first with the government--to shift our thinking to improving our interactions and processes to provide more value to the public. We are continuously improving to become a better government through innovation. We foster a culture of experimentation--using new methods and proven practices to address problems and build effective solutions. 

### Here are the principles we live by: 

1. Continuous improvement and flexibility 
2. Communication and sharing 
3. Effectiveness and efficiency; creating navigable pathways; using existing methods more efficiently; not defaulting to the same way of doing things 
4. Providing citizen (agency, team) value; clear articulation of value proposition 
5. Diversity and inclusion 
6. Prototyping and experimentation; being okay with failure  
7. Future planning 
8. Fairness 
9. Continuous learning and curiosity  
10. Measurable outcomes/goals and ROI; results oriented and evaluation 
11. Internal workings of government 
    1. Accountable 
    2. Comprehensive (x2) 
    3. Connected 
    4. Accessible (50% compliance, easy to find and understand information) 
    5. Leadership development/fellowship programs (injection of energized, go-getters) 
    6. Protective 
    7. Open-minded 
    8. Quality of service  
    9. Economic driver 
    10. Catalytic 
        1. Investment 
        2. Risk  
        3. Results 

    11. Multi-layered  
    12. Leading 
    13. Cogent and logical  
    14. Delivers concretely, on its mission and has measurable data/results to publicly show for it 
    15. Well-intentioned 
    16. Balanced budget 
    17. Problem solving 

12. Collaborative work with partners inside and outside government 
13. Embracing change and staying optimistic 
14. Holding people accountable for innovating 
15. Holistic thinking. Think about problems youâ€™re trying to solve and the outcomes you hope to achieve from the beginning.  
16. Innovation is not a one-size-fits all approach--can be small or big; Systemic change is long and slow; Innovation is a bit squishy; innovation thinking freely on how we get from A to Z, no rigid thinking.
