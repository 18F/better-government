# What is a better government? 

## Vision Statement
We envision a better relationship between the government and the public. Change should happen first with the government--to shift our thinking to improving our interactions and processes to provide more value to the public. We are continuously improving to become a better government through innovation. We foster a culture of experimentation--using new methods and proven practices to address problems and build effective solutions.
